  1) Exploratory Data Analysis

The data can be found in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata

Here we are going through the following steps to clean and prepare the data:
  - Handling outliers
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Check correlations and distributions
  - Log-transformation


  2) Clustering

In this notebook, we use the cleaned data to perform a segmentation with Kmean thanks to the following steps :
  - Define number of clusters based on Elbow and Silhouette methods and apply Kmean.
  - Visualization of key characterictics of clusters to understand the typology of customers.
  - Features importance to highlight the key criteria to segment the customers.
  - Cluster Analysis based on distance between the centroids and statistical tests (Mann-Whitney) to check if all clusters are significant.
